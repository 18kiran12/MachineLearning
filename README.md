# MachineLearning
Understanding Machine Learning and optimization concepts. <br />
This is the main folder where I add all the different concepts as different folders. <br /><br /><br /><br />
	1. Neural Networks  <br /><br />
        a. [Neural Networks/neural networks with Tensor Flow - MNIST.ipynb] - Neural Network using TensorFlow<br />
        b. [Neural Networks/Neural Network with Keras - pima-indians.ipynb] - Neural Network with Keras<br />
	c. [Neural Networks/Convolutional Neural Network/Convolutional Neural Network with Keras.ipynb] - Conv Neural Network with Keras<br />
	d. [Neural Networks/Convolutional Neural Network/Understanding Convolution 1D, 2D, 3D.ipynb] - How the 1D, 2D, 3D conv networks work and the features they capture<br /><br /><br /><br />
	2. Perceptron.<br /><br />
	  The perceptron is an algorithm for learning a binary classifier: a function that maps its input x (a real-valued vector) to an output value f(x) (a single binary value)    <br /><br />
	a. [Perceptron/Perceptron.ipynb] - Created a simple demonstration of how a perceptron can be used to make classifications.<br /><br /><br /><br />
	<t>3. Recommender systems.  <br /><br />
	A method to predict the "rating" or "preference" that a user would give to an item based on a few methods.<br /><br />
	Created a quick implementation of the following<br /><br />
	a. [Recommender System/Netflix Matrix factorization.ipynb] - Matrix Factorization on a subset of Netflix data. <br />
	b. [Recommender System/Recommender systems with cosine similarity function.ipynb] - Simple Collabrative filtering using cosine similarity. <br /><br /><br /><br />
	<t>4. Decision Trees.  <br /><br />
	a. [Decision Trees/decision tree.ipynb]Implementaion of Decision tree from scratch
