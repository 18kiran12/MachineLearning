# MachineLearning

Understanding Machine Learning and optimization concepts. 

This is the main folder where I add all the different concepts as different folders. 


Neural Networks 
---

* Neural Network complete implementation in numpy - [Neural Networks/NeuralNetworkPython.pdf]
* Neural Network using TensorFlow - [Neural Networks/neural networks with Tensor Flow - MNIST.ipynb]
* Neural Network with Keras - [Neural Networks/Neural Network with Keras - pima-indians.ipynb]
* Conv Neural Network with Keras - [Neural Networks/Convolutional Neural Network/Convolutional Neural Network with Keras.ipynb]
* How the 1D, 2D, 3D conv networks work - [Neural Networks/Convolutional Neural Network/Understanding Convolution 1D, 2D, 3D.ipynb]

Time Series Forecasting
---

* Forecasting time series data using ARIMA , SARIMAX - [Time series forecasting/Time series ARIMA, SARIMAX.ipynb]

Perceptron 
---

The perceptron is an algorithm for learning a binary classifier: 
a function that maps its input 'x' (a real-valued vector) to an output value 'f(x)' (a single binary value)

Created a simple demonstration of how a perceptron can be used to make classifications.

* Perceptron working - [Perceptron/Perceptron.ipynb]



Recommender Systems 
---

A method to predict the "rating" or "preference" that a user would give to an item based on a few methods.
Tried to created a quick implementation of the following

* Matrix Factorization on a subset of Netflix data - [Recommender System/Netflix Matrix factorization.ipynb]
* Simple Collabrative filtering using cosine similarity - [Recommender System/Recommender systems with cosine similarity function.ipynb]

Recommender Systems 
---

* Decision Trees - [Decision Trees/decision tree.ipynb]
